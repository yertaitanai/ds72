    "The British Royal Air Force wanted to know how many warplanes the Germans had (some number `N`, which is a *parameter*), and they needed to estimate that quantity knowing only a random sample of the planes' serial numbers (from 1 to `N`). We know that the German's warplanes are labeled consecutively from 1 to `N`, so `N` would be the total number of warplanes they have. \n",
    "\n",
    "We normally investigate the random variation among our estimates by simulating a sampling procedure from the population many times and computing estimates from each sample that we generate.  In real life, if the British Royal Air Force (RAF) had known what the population looked like, they would have known `N` and would not have had any reason to think about random sampling. However, they didn't know what the population looked like, so they couldn't have run the simulations that we normally do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating a sampling procedure many times was a useful exercise in *understanding random variation* for an estimate, but it's not as useful as a tool for practical data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's flip that sampling idea on its head to make it practical. **Given *just* a random sample of serial numbers, we'll estimate `N`, and then we'll use simulation to find out how accurate our estimate probably is, without ever looking at the whole population.**  This is an example of *statistical inference*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We (the RAF in World War II) want to know the number of warplanes fielded by the Germans.  That number is `N`.  The warplanes have serial numbers from 1 to `N`, so `N` is also equal to the largest serial number on any of the warplanes.\n",
    "\n",
